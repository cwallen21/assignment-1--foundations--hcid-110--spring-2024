        <p> Hello, my name is Cadian Wallen. I am a junior studying Computer and Electronic Engineering Technology at University of Hartford.
        On campus, I am the Residental Assistant at Hawk Hall, Tutor, CETA Ambassador, and G-Board member of NSBE. Off campus, I work at Tommy Bahama,
        which is located at the  Westfarms mall. I enjoy playing games with friends, playing sports like basketball and football, and 
        drawing. You can catch me around campus either with friends, hanging out with my residents in Hawk Hall, or in the Hursey Center 
        studying late night. Hope to meet you one day!
