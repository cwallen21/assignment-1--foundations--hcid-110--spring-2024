        I am currently enrolled as a junior at the University of Hartford and my goal is to graduate with a degree in Computer and 
        Electronic Engineering Technology. Once I graduate, I plan to secure a position as a Computer Engineer and use my skill set to 
        conduct analytical research, develop computer software and hardware, and create innovative technological designs and solutions. 
        My goal is to enhance or create electric equipment that will allow more power to transfer into electrical communication devices. 
        This would allow electrical products to charge at a faster rate and retain battery charge for a longer amount of time. Another 
        goal of mine is to create a computer security software that would be vital to the computer industry. By working in this field, 
        I will be able to impart my knowledge to help solve and to prevent an assault on cyber breaching on companies' networking systems. 
        Enhancing computer software security would likely improve the quality of technology on a personal and commercial level.

        I am from Manchester, Connecticut and lived here my whole life. I come from a Jamaican household that strongly valued 
        education and viewed it as a necessity to succeed in life. As a result, I was able to see the importance of furthering
        my education so I strive for that by putting my full effort into my education. I travel almost every summer so I been to 
        a lot of places. I've been to Jamaica, Canada, New York, Chicago, North Carolina, Florida, Las Vegas, and many more. In my 
        freetime, I enjoy playing Fallout New Vegas, GTA, and Resident Evil 4 Remake. When I'm playing with friends, 
        we usually play Dead by Daylight, Call of Duty, Lethal Company, and Party Animals. I also produce music using FL Studio when I have 
        time. Its fun to play around with different sounds and eventually produce music I'd enjoy. When I get better at it, I might 
        have to drop music on this website.
